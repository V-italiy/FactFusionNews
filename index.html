                Vehicles</span
              >
              A breakthrough in solid-state battery technology promises to
              double the range of electric vehicles while significantly reducing
              charging times. These next-generation batteries, which are safer
              and more durable than traditional lithium-ion models, are expected
              to hit the market in the coming year, marking a new era for EV
              innovation.

              <span>Self-Healing Concrete Starts Urban Trials in Europe</span>
              Urban areas across Europe are testing self-healing concrete, a
              revolutionary material that repairs cracks using bacteria and
              special polymers. This innovation promises to extend the lifespan
              of infrastructure, reduce maintenance costs, and promote
              sustainable construction practices.

              <span>TikTok Faces Potential U.S. Ban</span> A U.S. court has
              denied TikTok’s request to pause enforcement of a possible ban
              while awaiting Supreme Court review. The decision could mark a
              turning point for the popular app's operations in the country amid
              ongoing national security concerns.
