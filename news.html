                <span>Self-Healing Concrete Starts Urban Trials in Europe</span>
                Urban areas across Europe are testing self-healing concrete, a
                revolutionary material that repairs cracks using bacteria and
                special polymers. This innovation promises to extend the
                lifespan of infrastructure, reduce maintenance costs, and
                promote sustainable construction practices.

                Europe is rolling out solar-powered smart roads that generate
                electricity directly from the pavement. These innovative
                roadways feature embedded solar panels and sensors to produce
                energy, monitor traffic, and optimize road safety, marking a new
                era in sustainable infrastructure.

                denied TikTok’s request to pause enforcement of a possible ban
                while awaiting Supreme Court review. The decision could mark a
                turning point for the popular app's operations in the country
                amid ongoing national security concerns.

                A breakthrough in solid-state battery technology promises to
                double the range of electric vehicles while significantly
                reducing charging times. These next-generation batteries, which
                are safer and more durable than traditional lithium-ion models,
                are expected to hit the market in the coming year, marking a new
                era for EV innovation.
